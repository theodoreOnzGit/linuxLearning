# Why Learn Linux?

When introducing people to linux, the first question that often comes to
mind is "What distribution do I use?"

One of the most common answers given is "What do you want to use it for?".
This is the most common questions asked back from many experienced Linux 
Users.

Having come from a windows background and having worked my way to 
Arch Linux, I can see why both sides ask and answer...


## The Windows Perspective

Like many of you, I come from a windows background. I remember playing games
on windows, using Microsoft Office for work, surfing the web and learning
coding all on windows.

Windows gives you the computing experience where you don't have to think
about many many things. For example, you don't usually need to think about
where to install your video game files, where to store the drivers, which
hardware goes with which graphics card driver and so on.

Part of the allure of windows is that almost everything behind the scenes
is decided for you. When coming to linux with such a mindset, I'd probably want
a similar experience. This means that everything is decided for me, I just
want to use whatever program I want to do whatever I want,

I'd probably want to search the web or google for what I want, install it with
minimal thinking and effort, and just have it work. The experience should
be seamless and integrated.

However, it's hard to articulate this because the typical windows or mac
computing experience is that things are fed to you and decided for you.
Answers are often given before you even knew you needed to ask the question.

Hence, when experienced linux users ask you "What do you want?". The experience
can often be frustration.

## The Linux Perspective (at least mine)

I never really understood why experienced Linux Users would answer such
a question with another one. It was helpful to have answers but borderline
annoying for me. 

However, as I started delving deeper and deeper into Linux, I began to understand
why some people would answer in such a manner.

The key selling point of the Linux experience is customisation. One reason
I enjoy Linux so much is the freedom it offers, the freedom of choice. 
If you don't like a distribution, choose another one. If you don't like an
app, choose another one. If you don't like your bootloader or desktop
environment, choose another one.

You are spoiled for choice in the Linux world. It is enjoyable, provided you
know exactly what you are looking for. If not, the myriad of choices becomes
more of a burden than an enjoyment.

## Your First Steps are to Ask the Right Question...

All in all, your first steps in Linux should not be:

1. "What do I install?"
2. "How do I install X?"

But rather, 

1. What goals or purpose do you have in mind?



## Some helpful tips

From a windows or mac perspective where so many things are decided for you,
it can be hard to answer such a question.

Perhaps I can suggest a few options to start.

1. Business or Pleasure?
2. Is budget an issue?
3. List three things you like most and dislike most about your current 
computing experience.
